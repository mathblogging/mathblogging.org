## What is mathblogging.org?

From research to recreation, from teaching to technology, from visual to virtual, there are hundreds of blogs and web sites writing about mathematics and its many facets. For the longest time there was no good way for math readers to discover math writers, and for math writers to be found. We want to change that.

We have collected over 600 blogs and other news sources in one place. That number is steadily growing, and we invite you to submit even more! Meanwhile our editors showcase their favorite articles ([home](/)) and sites ([featured](/featured.html)). Our goal is to be the best place to seek out math-related content on the web.

## Submit your blog!

If you are writing about mathy things, we are happy to include you here on mathblogging.org. Either [write us an email](mailto:mathblogging.network@gmail.com) or send us a tweet [@mathblogging](https://twitter.com/mathblogging).

## Our team of editors

**Dana Ernst** is a professor of mathematics at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> in Flagstaff, AZ, and blogs at <a href="danaernst.com">danaernst.com</a>. Dana is passionate about mathematics education and his scholarly activities include topics in this area. In particular, he is interested in <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) as a method for teaching mathematics. Dana is also a Special Projects Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/">Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning</a> and actively gives <a href="http://danaernst.com/category/talks">talks</a> and organizes workshops on the benefits of IBL as well as the nuts and bolts of how to implement this approach in the mathematics classroom. Together with Angie Hodge, Dana is a coauthor for <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/">Math Ed Matters</a>, which is a (roughly) monthly column sponsored by the <a href="http://maa.org">MAA</a>. Lastly, Dana is an avid cyclist, trail runner, and rock climber. Oh, and he enjoys drinking copious amounts of coffee.

**Patrick Honner** is an award-winning high school math teacher currently residing in Brooklyn, New York.  Patrick has taught everything from introductory algebra to multivariable Calculus, and mentors student research and writing in mathematics.  Patrick is a regular contributor to the <a href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/">New York Times Learning Network</a>, and shares his love of mathematics and teaching through writing and photography at <a href="http://www.MrHonner.com">MrHonner.com</a>.

**Fawn Nguyen** teaches math at Mesa Union Junior High in southern California. She has been a science teacher since 1990 and a math teacher since 1994. Fawn is part of the UC-Santa Barbara Mathematics Project leadership team that presents at workshops and retreats for math teachers, coaches, and administrators in the Tri-County area. She is a cofounder of the  <a href="http://www.mathteacherscircleto.org/">Thousand Oaks Math Teachersâ€™ Circle</a>. In an effort to share and learn from other math teachers, Fawn blogs at <a href="http://fawnnguyen.com/">Finding Ways to Nguyen Students Over</a>. She also started <a href="http://visualpatterns.org/">VisualPatterns.org</a> to help students develop algebraic thinking. In the next life, Fawn dreams of owning a vineyard and becoming a committed foodie. Meanwhile, she enjoys cooking and watching college football&mdash;not at the same time.

**Shecky Riemann** is the fanciful pseudonym of a former psychology major and lab-tech (primarily clinical genetics), who's been enamored of mathematics since childhood. Following Martin Gardner's death (2010), he was inspired to create <a href="http://math-frolic.blogspot.com/">Math-Frolic</a> blog to pay tribute to Gardner and be a cheerleader-of-sorts for those doing, or interested in, mathematics. He's especially intrigued with number theory, geometry, and the philosophical underpinnings of math. Cats, parrots and shelties adore him.

... and more coming soon!
