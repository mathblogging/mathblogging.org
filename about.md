## Editors

**Dana Ernst** is a professor of mathematics at <a href="http://nau.edu">Northern Arizona University</a> in Flagstaff, AZ, and blogs at <a href="danaernst.com">danaernst.com</a>. Dana is passionate about mathematics education and his scholarly activities include topics in this area. In particular, he is interested in <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html">inquiry-based learning</a> (IBL) as a method for teaching mathematics. Dana is also a Special Projects Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org/">Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning</a> and actively gives <a href="http://danaernst.com/category/talks">talks</a> and organizes workshops on the benefits of IBL as well as the nuts and bolts of how to implement this approach in the mathematics classroom. Together with Angie Hodge, Dana is a coauthor for <a href="http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/">Math Ed Matters</a>, which is a (roughly) monthly column sponsored by the <a href="http://maa.org">MAA</a>. Lastly, Dana is an avid cyclist, trail runner, and rock climber. Oh, and he enjoys drinking copious amounts of coffee.

**Patrick Honner** is an award-winning high school math teacher currently residing in Brooklyn, New York.  Patrick has taught everything from introductory algebra to multivariable Calculus, and mentors student research and writing in mathematics.  Patrick is a regular contributor to the <a href="http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/">New York Times Learning Network</a>, and shares his love of mathematics and teaching through writing and photography at <a href="http://www.MrHonner.com">MrHonner.com</a>.

**Fawn Nguyen** teaches math at Mesa Union Junior High in southern California. She started out as a science teacher for 14 years and has been teaching math for the last 10 years. Fawn is part of the UC-Santa Barbara Mathematics Project leadership team that presents at workshops and retreats for math teachers, coaches, and administrators in the Tri-County area. She is a co-founder of the  <a href="http://www.mathteacherscircleto.org/">Thousand Oaks Math Teachersâ€™ Circle</a>. In an effort to share and learn from other math teachers, Fawn blogs at <a href="http://fawnnguyen.com/">Finding Ways to Nguyen Students Over</a>. She also started <a href="http://visualpatterns.org/">VisualPatterns.org</a> to help students develop algebraic thinking. When she can pull herself away from her passion and love of all things mathy, Fawn likes to take motorcycle rides with her husband.

**Shecky Riemann** is the fanciful pseudonym of a former psychology major and lab-tech (primarily clinical genetics), who's been enamored of mathematics since childhood. Following Martin Gardner's death (2010), he was inspired to create <a href="http://math-frolic.blogspot.com/">Math-Frolic</a> blog to pay tribute to Gardner and be a cheerleader-of-sorts for those doing, or interested in, mathematics. He's especially intrigued with number theory, geometry, and the philosophical underpinnings of math. Cats, parrots and shelties adore him.
